# Hardware Board Design for STM32F070F6
`STM32F070F6` is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 mircrocontroller from ST. This repository contains the hardware files needed for creating a basic board for working with this micro controller. I am using **KiCad(5.0.1)** as the EDA tool.

## Notes
1. Changed the switches with were earlier decieded from *robu.in* to [this](https://in.element14.com/alcoswitch-te-connectivity/fsmsm/switch-spst-0-05a-24vdc-smd/dp/1703878) from element14, as mechanical dimentions were not available.
