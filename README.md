# Hardware Board Design for STM32F070F6
`STM32F070F6` is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller from ST. This repository contains the hardware files needed for creating a basic board for working with this micro controller. 

EDA Tool: **KiCad(5.0.1)**.

**Many thanks to [Balram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balram-jatav-0a6467114/) for helping me out with the PCB design :slightly_smiling_face:**

## Notes
1. Changed the switches with were earlier decieded from *robu.in* to [this](https://in.element14.com/alcoswitch-te-connectivity/fsmsm/switch-spst-0-05a-24vdc-smd/dp/1703878) from element14, as mechanical dimentions were not available.
